## Surveys

  >- A researcher often collects data about a population through surveys
  >- If the survey reaches the entire population it is called a census
  >- Typically surveys only sample a portion of the population

## Categorizing a Survey 

  >- Two primary data collection methods
  >- Experiments and observational studies
  >- A survey is an observational study

## Disciminating Experiments and Observational Studies

  >- In experiments, the researchers intentionally interfere with the subjects.
  >- In observational studies, the researchers attempt to minimize any inteference with the subjects (merely observing).

## Differences in Possible Conclusions from Experiments and Observational Studies

  >- In experiments, it is possible to infer causal relationships between variables.
  >- In observational studies, it is possible to identify associations between variables.
  >- **Caution**: association does not imply causation.
  
## Types of Variables

  >- Categorical 
  >- Numerical
