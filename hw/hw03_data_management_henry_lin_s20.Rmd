## Project Set-up
Library necessary packages 
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)
```

## Load in original data 
Load in your raw data file - with `load` command for the `addhealth4` data
```{r}
load("/cloud/project/data/addhealth4.RData")
```


## New data frame with selected variables 
```{r}
mydata <- addhealth4 %>% 
  select(H4LM20, H4LM17, H4LM26, H4LM14, H4LM28, H4LM30, H4LM19, H4LM12)
```

## Cleaned data frame

**Step 1** : Select only the variables that you want to keep, so you only have the version of the variables that you want in your data frame.
```{r}
clean <- addhealth4 %>% select(H4LM20, H4LM17, H4LM26, H4LM14, H4LM28, H4LM30, H4LM19, H4LM12)
```

**Step 2**: Save the resulting data set to your `data` folder as `datasetname_clean.Rdata` e.g. `addhealth_clean.Rdata`. 
```{r}
save(clean, file="/cloud/project/data/addhealth_clean.Rdata")
```

```{r}
glimpse(mydata)
glimpse(clean)
```
