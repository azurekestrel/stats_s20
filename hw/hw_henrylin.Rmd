## Part 2: Examination and Improvement of our Learning 

### Habits for Success
5.  Your **one** observation or question from the videos or podcast.

I listened to the podcast.....
I noticed that there is indeed some people that will rush to meet whatever the future offers. However, there and plenty that will be more hesitant. Yet, some will so far as to completely reject it. Although some concerns are justified, there should be even the slightest acknowledgement that the future is coming and the the only reasonable response is to adapt to it when it does. Even if there is a massive dislike of the future, there remains a necessity for people to interface with it when it comes.

Unfortunately, at times, there are people that take it to an extreme degree, that renders them unable to respond to the slightest ripple, even if it is absolutely necessary. Sometimes, it's just the simple belief that what can be done is pointless, leading people to lose hope. However, sometime, biases put people into situations where they are no longer to even slightly acknowledge that there is something very wrong and are comfortable with such a condition.

6.  Your **one** thing that you will attempt to incorporate into your studies this semester.

To better assess and anticipate patterns that will emerge through the semester in an effort to better allocate time and attention.

### Learning Strategies
7. Answer at least **4** of the following questions from the reading. (please remove unanswered questions)  

    + What was the most important insight you gained from the reading? 
      + That the way high school is run today creates a certain amount of complacency in potential college students.
    + What surprised you most in the reading?
      + That there are people that think that high school is "free". Never has, is, or will be free.
    + What did you already know?
      + That although there are some instructors that are legitimately awful, there is a good, if not decent chance that negligence will do a student in as quickly.
    + How will you prepare differently for exams, given what you read?
      + More to use technology as a pivot point, rather than as a means to an end. As a pointer to find the right information in the right places.
    + Can you think of other good learning practices that the reading didn't mention?
      + That there will be courses that are mandatory but of no interest to the majority of students, such as ethnic studies, that will be imposed as part of graduation requirements and it is ok to not be interested as long as you're honest about it. If people took interest in every single little thing in the situations other people encounter, then we may as well just accecpt all the suffering in the world as our own personal liabilities; which is unreasonable in the first place.
